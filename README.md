# Attic-Films-production-Company-

Quiet Attic Films is a film production company based in London, England who specialize in making short information films and advertisements for television. They want you to design and implement a database that meets the requirements for their data. These requirements are specified in this scenario and the examples of paper documents kept by the company shown below. 
Quiet Attic Films organize their data around the concept of a ‘production’. A production is specified as being for a particular client; but note that a client might have more than one production at any time. A production will take place at one or more locations. A production will also use a number of, what are called, properties, which might be anything from an actual property like a building, to costumes or small items of any sort. It is important to keep a record of which properties are required at which location.
 There should also be a record kept of the staff types that are assigned to productions
